### 💬 Add comments where necessary
- Use inline comments to explain non-obvious code sections.

### 🧾 Follow Python PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use 4 spaces per indentation level
- Keep lines under 79 characters
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add docstrings (`"""Description"""`) for classes and functions

---

## 3. Test Your Changes

Before submitting your contribution, verify that everything works as expected.

- 🧪 Run all tools to ensure they function correctly
- 🔍 Test edge cases and error handling thoroughly
- 🧰 Validate that new tools integrate smoothly into the repository
- 🧾 Ensure that any dependencies are clearly mentioned
- 📊 Check console output and exceptions for clarity and consistency

---

## 4. Update Documentation

Keep documentation up to date for every new contribution.

- Add your new tool to the main **README.md**
- Include usage examples, command syntax, and expected outputs
- Document any external dependencies or required Python modules

---

## 5. Commit Your Changes

Use the following command to commit:

git commit -m "Add: Brief description of your changes"

text

### 🧾 Use Conventional Commit Messages

- `Add:` → for new features or tools
- `Fix:` → for bug fixes
- `Update:` → for updates to existing tools
- `Docs:` → for documentation changes

---

## 6. Push to Your Fork

## 7. Open a Pull Request

When opening your Pull Request (PR):

- 🧾 Use a clear title and descriptive message
- 🔗 Reference any related issues (e.g., "Fixes #12")

## 📝 Coding Guidelines

### 🧾 Python Style Guide

Follow best practices for clarity and maintainability:

- Follow PEP 8 standards
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions simple and focused (single responsibility)
- Add docstrings for functions and classes
- Include error handling with try-except blocks

### 📁 File Organization

Organize your tool inside the `tools/` directory:

tools/
├── risk_scoring_calculator.py
├── policy_compliance_checker.py
├── audit_logger.py
├── incident_report_formatter.py
├── control_gap_analyzer.py
└── grc_data_visualizer.py
